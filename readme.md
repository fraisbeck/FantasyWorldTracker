This Fantasy World Tracker will be designed to help people establish locations within towns, within regions, within countries,
and within continents.  It will allow people to easily find certain stores, landmarks, even People of interest for easier organizations
and help them remember what they are looking for or what they encountered last time they were there.  It will also allow the creator to keep 
inventories at certain stores of items so that they can keep track of several different stores all at once and remember where certain
items they may want to find later can be purchased at.
