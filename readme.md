# Frank Raisbeck Individual Project

### Problem Statement

For anyone creating any fantasy world be it for a game they are running or a book you're writing keeping track of every location down to a store name on different planets.  I'm making this database for people
to log into and keep track of their own worlds down to the shops they populate the land with and everything in between.
With the growing popularity of RPG genre books and table top games that require a lot of world building I hope this app can be used for an easy look up database
to keep track of everything they may need.

This Fantasy World Tracker will be designed to help people establish locations within towns, within regions, within countries,
and within continents.  It will allow people to easily find certain stores, landmarks, even People of interest for easier organizations
and help them remember what they are looking for or what they encountered last time they were there.  It will also allow the creator to keep 
inventories at certain stores of items so that they can keep track of several different stores all at once and remember where certain
items they may want to find later can be purchased at.
