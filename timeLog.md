Week 1:     Week one I got my VM set up and read through the class work for the week.  I started listing out ideas for personal
project ideas to work on and came up with something to present as an idea.  I finished my lab work and exercise's for the week

Week 2:     I watched all the videos for class and got my Indie project folders set up.  I worked on the exercise and started laying out
            on paper what how my indie project setup would look like so I know what files and tables I'll need to create are going forward.
